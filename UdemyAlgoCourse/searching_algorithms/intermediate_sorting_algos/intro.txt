Unlike the other algos (bubble, insertion and selection) merge quick and radix sort are O(n log n) algorithms. This means that they are much faster than the O(n^2) algorithms. Merge sort is a stable sort, which means that it preserves the order of equal elements. This is important when you are sorting objects that have multiple keys. Merge sort is also a comparison sort, which means that it can sort any type of data for which a comparison function is defined.

How merge sort works:
    - its a combination of two things - merging and sorting
    - it exploits the fact that arrays of 0 or 1 element are always sorted
    - works by decomposing an array into smaller arrays of 0 or 1 elements, then building up a newly sorted array
    - You start with one array and split it in half, then you split those in half, and so on until you have a bunch of arrays with only one element
    - Then you merge those arrays back together, in the correct order
